        <h1>About</h1>
            <element class="box box1">I am a transplant from Northern Indiana, and have recently started calling NKY home.
                A great deal of my time is spent admiring the architechture and the history of this area;
                it's so incredibly different from back home.
                I created this page as a way to display my favorite pieces of NKY.
