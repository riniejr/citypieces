# citypieces

DESCRIPTION:

Welcome to my site! This project was inspired with three intentions: 
      1) learn about how to code and what can be done with it 
      2) get outside and take more photos (with an actual camera, not my phone) and
      3) display these photos on a responsive website using the features listed below.

I moved to Northern Kentucky in 2017 and have spent a great deal of my time 
looking up and around in awe at the incredible and diverse architechture in this area.
My partner, a native to these parts, never understood why I was so entranced until he visited 
my parents' home in Indiana. Between the two is a completely different vibe and style (for the most part).

The pictures I've chosen to display are pieces of Northern Kentucky 
that make me stop and look, even if just for a moment. It might be an old building, public art,
or various flowers and plants (it's probably a sunflower). It was also important that the photo looked presentable. 
As an amateur photographer, I still have a lot to learn. The "auto" setting doesn't always get the job done. 
I plan to continue to add to this project as I find more places and spaces,
and eventually will add location tags, so that others can find and experience them in person.

I hope you enjoy perusing through the images and would love to hear (in the contact section!) of places you admire
or like to visit just for the sake of the view, whether it's Northern Kentucky or Northern Ireland.

Take the time to stop and take it all, you never know what you're missing.

Cheers!
